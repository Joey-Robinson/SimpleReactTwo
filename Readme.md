Title: Simple React
Description: A simple React boilerplate that supports scss
---

Q: What is this? <br>
A: This is a simple React boilerplate that allows the usage of scss. This uses a stripped down version, if you will, of everything in the project. Without using CRA, you can accomplish the same functionality without the bloat.

Q: Why make this?<br>
A: I wanted support for scss without the pain of ejecting and wanted to play with webpack. CRA doesn't allow (if it does, oh well) the usage of scss. Also, npm start would result in a crash with CRA, so there's this.

Q: How to use?<br>
A: Clone or Download. Type npm install. Type npm start. Enjoy.

Q: How can I use this for production?<br>
A: I don't know. I'm working on that as I'm typing this. I'll update the Readme when I find a solution.

If there's something here that isn't being used and someone (no one is going to use this) comes across it, tell me or submit a pr.
